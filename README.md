[CVPR 2025] This is the official implementation of paper "Synthetic Data is an Elegant GIFT for Continual Vision-Language Models". In the paper we present GIFT, a novel continual fine-tuning approach for vision-language models, aimed at leveraging synthetic data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. The code we provide can be used to reproduce the results of our method in the MTIL experimental setting.

## Overview

![Framework Overview](figures/frame.png)

Framework overview of GIFT. (a) **Synthetic Data-based Distillation** aligns the output of the current CLIP model $\theta^t$ with the previous model $\theta^{t-1}$ on matching synthetic image-text pairs when learning a new task. Image-text alignment loss is applied to correct errors in the teacher model through hard target, i.e., the alignment matrix. (b) **Adaptive Weight Consolidation** employs a parameter importance weighted $l_2$ penalty to limit parameter changes causing forgetting and overfitting. By leveraging the Fisher information $\mathcal{F}_{\theta^t}$ from synthetic image-text pairs during training, parameter importance is adjusted in real-time to achieve a better stability-plasticity balance.

## Configure the Project

In order to run the code properly, you must first fill in the corresponding path in `project_config.json`. We have given examples using relative paths. But to be safe, it is best to replace them with the absolute paths on your machine.

```json
{
    "_comment": "configure the path for project",
    "CL_DATA_LOCATION": null,
    "MTIL_DATA_LOCATION": "./data/mtil",
    "SYN_DATA_LOCATION": "./data/synthetic",
    "CKPT_LOCATION": ".ckpt/"
}
```

Here is an explanation of each item:

- `CL_DATA_LOCATION`: where the CIL datasets are. (not used in this repo)
- `MTIL_DATA_LOCATION`: where the MTIL datasets are.
- `SYN_DATA_LOCATION`: where the synthetic datasets are.
- `CKPT_LOCATION`: where to store checkpoints.

## Environment Set Up

Our project relies on `Python 3.8.18`. First, you need to ensure that `pytorch` of version higher than `1.11.0` is installed. Then install other required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

## Prepare to Generate Images

We use `Stable Diffusion` v1.5 for inference via the toolkit [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers). Diffusers can be installed simply as follows:

```bash
pip install --upgrade diffusers[torch]
```

We have prepared the prompts we use in path `./data/synthetic` in advance, and can directly run `txt2img.py` to generate synthetic images:

```bash
# Generate for MTIL Order I
python txt2img.py --image_num=1000 --setting=MTIL_I --datasetname=synthetic_data_a
# Generate for MTIL Order II
python txt2img.py --image_num=1000 --setting=MTIL_II --datasetname=synthetic_data_b
```

For convenience, we pre-generate the generated images used by all tasks before continual learning starts.

Note that in the constructor of the `ImgGenerator` class on `line 74` of `txt2img.py`, the pre-trained weights are obtained by default from the [stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5](https://huggingface.co/stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5) repository on the Hugging Face website. 

```python
class ImgGenerator:
    def __init__(self, device, model_path = "stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5", scheduler=False):
        self.device = device
        self.pipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_path, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
        
        if scheduler:
            self.pipeline.scheduler = DPMSolverMultistepScheduler.from_config(self.pipeline.scheduler.config)
        
        self.pipeline.to(f"cuda:{device}")
```

If there are loadable local weights, you can modify the instance creation code on `line 118` to pass in the corresponding path as the `model_path` parameter. We recommend downloading the model first and then loading it locally.

```python
generator = ImgGenerator(device = args.device_id, scheduler=(args.steps < 50), model_path="your/path/to/model/weights")
```

## Prepare MTIL Datasets

All datasets of MTIL including `Aircraft`, `Caltech101`, `CIFAR10`, `CIFAR100`, `DTD`, `EuroSAT`, `Flowers`, `Food`, `MNIST`, `OxfordPet`, `StanfordCars`, `SUN397`. 
You can use `gather_datasets.py` to download directly through pytorch api. However, some links may be invalid and you need to find new links through the official website of corresponding datasets. 

## Run Experiments

After MTIL datasets downloading and image synthesis, use the following command to run experiment:

```bash
# Run on MTIL Order I
python ./scripts/run_exp.py --config_path=./configs/mtil_order_I.json
# Run on MTIL Order II
python ./scripts/run_exp.py --config_path=./configs/mtil_order_II.json
```

Or use `run_exp.sh` after authorization.
